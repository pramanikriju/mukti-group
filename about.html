                    spread across Eastern India in the areas of Real Estate (residential and commercial),

                        <h3>History of the Group </h3>
                        <p> Mukti Group was formed in 1984 and played a key role in the
                            growth of real estate in Eastern India by developing several state-of-the-art residential and
                            commercial properties. In 2009, the Group ventured into the entertainment and hospitality
                            sector through ‘Mukti World’ - a sought-after entertainment and dining hub. In 2010, the
                            Group launched its own multiplex brand - ‘London Paris Multiplex’. In 2012, the Company
                            forayed into the hospitality sector through Kolkata’s first international five-star hotel ‘Park
                            Plaza’ in a management tie-up with the Radisson Hotel Group. In 2018, ‘Park Plaza’ was
                            upgraded to ‘Radisson’.</p>

                        <p> It is a matter of pride for me to introduce Mukti Group, one of the
                            prestigious institutions in Eastern India. Since the Group’s first business venture in 1984, it
                            has been instrumental in its contribution to the development of real estate in Eastern India.
                            After successfully launching several residential and commercial projects, the Group forayed
                            into Hospitality and Entertainment.<br>
                            Kolkata provides an access to North East India and with initiatives to promote industry and
                            tourism by the Government of West Bengal over the past few years, the potential for
                            business and leisure travellers has increased significantly. Considering this, many of the
                            world’s best known hospitality brands are looking to the East.
                            After its strong presence in East India, the Group is focusing on spreading its wings to the
                            Northern and Western parts of India. The Group plans to contribute to the development of
                            infrastructure of international standards in the areas of education, health care and
                            entertainment.<br>
                            Above all, we want to be a responsible corporate. My family and businesses are actively
                            involved in the development of under-privileged families and strive to provide a safe and
                            happy work environment for our team-members.
                            I thank everyone who has been a part of our journey and look forward to your continued
                            support and good wishes.<br>
                            With my very best regards,<br>
                            R.K. Gupta,<br>
