<!--                <h3>Real Estate</h3>-->
                <p>Mukti Group was formed with the vision of developing best-in-class residences
                    and commercial properties. The Group has set benchmarks with each project and has played a
                    key role in developing the region where it operated. The Group’s <strong>first project was in the
                    Hooghly belt </strong>in West Bengal, which was neglected until the Group developed it into a vibrant
                    region. It is also credited with <strong>introducing the concept of ownership of multi-storeyed residential
                    apartments</strong> in the region. The Group has created a permanent impression on the skyline of
                    Kolkata with a commercial property, <strong>Mukti Chambers, built in the heart of Dalhousie</strong> – the CBD
                    of Kolkata. Mukti Chambers houses offices of many prominent national and multinational
                    organisations.<br>
                    In 2009, the Group ventured into the <strong>entertainment and hospitality sector</strong> through a boutique
                    mall <strong>‘Mukti World’</strong> in the posh area of Ballygunge in South Kolkata. It is an address for the
                    Eastern region flagship store of a <strong>leading multinational jewellery brand</strong> and also houses a
                    <strong>premium multiplex – ‘London Paris’</strong> which is owned and operated by Mukti Group.
                    In 2012, the Group forayed into the burgeoning hospitality sector through Kolkata’s<strong> first
                    international five-star hotel</strong> ‘Park Plaza’, also located in Ballygunge, in a management tie-up
                    with the Radisson Hotel Group. Mukti Group played a pioneering sectoral role by getting the
                    Radisson Hotel Group – one of the world’s prominent hospitality companies - to enter East
                    India. In 2018, Park Plaza was upgraded to <strong>‘Radisson Kolkata Ballygunge’</strong>.<br>
                    After its strong presence in East India, the Group is focusing on spreading its wings to the
                    Northern and Western parts of India. The Group plans to contribute to the development of
                    infrastructure of international standards in the areas of education, health care and
                    entertainment.</p>

                        <h3>History of the Group </h3>
                        <p> Mukti Group was formed in 1984 and played a key role in the
                            growth of real estate in Eastern India by developing several state-of-the-art residential and
                            commercial properties. In 2009, the Group ventured into the entertainment and hospitality
                            sector through ‘Mukti World’ - a sought-after entertainment and dining hub. In 2010, the
                            Group launched its own multiplex brand - ‘London Paris Multiplex’. In 2012, the Company
                            forayed into the hospitality sector through Kolkata’s first international five-star hotel ‘Park
                            Plaza’ in a management tie-up with the Radisson Hotel Group. In 2018, ‘Park Plaza’ was
                            upgraded to ‘Radisson’.</p>

                        <h3>Chairman Speak </h3>
                        <p> It is a matter of pride for me to introduce Mukti Group, one of the
                            prestigious institutions in Eastern India. Since the Group’s first business venture in 1984, it
                            has been instrumental in its contribution to the development of real estate in Eastern India.
                            After successfully launching several residential and commercial projects, the Group forayed
                            into Hospitality and Entertainment.<br>
                            Kolkata provides an access to North East India and with initiatives to promote industry and
                            tourism by the Government of West Bengal over the past few years, the potential for
                            business and leisure travellers has increased significantly. Considering this, many of the
                            world’s best known hospitality brands are looking to the East.
                            After its strong presence in East India, the Group is focusing on spreading its wings to the
                            Northern and Western parts of India. The Group plans to contribute to the development of
                            infrastructure of international standards in the areas of education, health care and
                            entertainment.<br>
                            Above all, we want to be a responsible corporate. My family and businesses are actively
                            involved in the development of under-privileged families and strive to provide a safe and
                            happy work environment for our team-members.
                            I thank everyone who has been a part of our journey and look forward to your continued
                            support and good wishes.<br>
                            With my very best regards,<br>
